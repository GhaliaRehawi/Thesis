# Thesis
## Purpose: 

The core purpose of this thesis is the comparison between the three most used **novelty detection** methods in the literature namely, **Gaussian mixture models**, **one-class support vectors machine** and **k-nearest neighbors**. Also different feature extraction methods are discussed and compared. The three methods are trained on the GAPs data set (The German Asphalt Pavement Distress), [Eisenbach et al., 2017], using only the intact data with the goal of detecting distress in the images. GAPs is the first freely available pavement distress dataset providing high quality images recorded by a standardized process fulfilling German federal regulations. This will provide a base for a fair comparison of researches in this field.
